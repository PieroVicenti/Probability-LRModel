Explored three machine learning models to predict house prices:

1) Created a Python File that created a CSV file with fake random data about houses in different locations and with different details.

2) Once the dataset was ready, decided to test three different models (Built models: Created instances of each model type): 
   Prepared the data: Cleaned, encoded, and split it into training and testing sets.
   
  2.1 Linear Regression: This classic model assumes a linear relationship between the features (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms, location) and the target variable (price). 
      It's a simple and interpretable model, but might not capture complex non-linear relationships.

  2.2 Decision Trees: Decision trees are more flexible than linear regression, allowing for non-linear relationships. 
      They make decisions based on a series of if-else questions, creating a tree-like structure.

  2.3  Random Forest: This ensemble model combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. 
      It's generally more robust and can handle complex patterns in the data.

Trained the models: Fitted the models to the training data to learn the relationships between features and the target.
Made predictions: Used the trained models to predict house prices on unseen data.
Evaluated performance: Measured the models' accuracy using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

Methods such as Scatter plots, box plots, histograms and heatmaps have been used to visualize data.
